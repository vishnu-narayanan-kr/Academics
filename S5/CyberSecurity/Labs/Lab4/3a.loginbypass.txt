End goal:
Use SQL injection in the username field to login as administrator

Analysis:

Step 1:
Check if the given website as SQL injection vulnerability by adding a ' to the username field
Command: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''' AND password = ''
Excecuted Command:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '''
