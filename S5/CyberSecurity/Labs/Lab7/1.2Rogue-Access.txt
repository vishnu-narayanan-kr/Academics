sudo airmon-ng check

after booting into kali linux in VirtualBox, In the VM menu, removable devices, disconnect the adapter from host,
and connect it directly to virtual machine

when I do iwconfig,
I can't find the wlan adapter

I use TP Link AC600 as external usb wifi adapter, so I had to update the driver
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dkms git build-essential bc

Install the chipset
git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl8812au

update kernel headers, and boot into correct header

make clean
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe 8812au

once you can see the wlan0 option in iwconfig,

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 => to monitor
sudo airbase-ng -e "Free_WiFi" -c 6 wlan0
